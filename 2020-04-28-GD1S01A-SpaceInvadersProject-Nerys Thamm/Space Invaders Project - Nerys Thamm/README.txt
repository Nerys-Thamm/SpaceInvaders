Space Invaders: Swarm

A fresh take on the classic arcade game 'Space Invaders'
by Nerys Thamm

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Controls:

Aiming your weapon: The weapon will always point towards your mouse cursor, so use it to aim.

Firing your weapon: Press Spacebar to fire your weapon

Moving your Shield: Your shield will automatically move towards the back of your spaceship, but you can manually control it with the A and D keys

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Aim of the game:

The aim of the game is to survive as many waves of aliens as you can, and accumulate the highest score you can.
You can see what wave you're on, along with your current score, in the bottom left of the gameplay window.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Aliens:

There are four different types of aliens you can encounter while playing, these are:

Alien Drones: These are white, rotating disc shaped craft with four robotic arms, and a singular red eye located in the centre of their bodies.
These enemies are destroyed when hit with one of your bullets, or when consumed by an explosion.
Alien Drones will try to approach your spaceship and damage it, so its important to shoot them down before they do!

Alien Blue Drones: These are similar to regular alien drones, but they have a shield which will protect them from one bullet before deactivating.
You can spot Alien Blue Drones by their eyes, which are blue.

Alien Gunships: Alien Gunships are small mobile Missile launchers that bombard your spaceship with highly explosive missiles, which can be recognised by their three thrusters
and large opening, from which a missile can be seen poking out. Alien Gunships can be destroyed by a bullet, or by an explosion.

Alien Special Drones: Alien Special Drones are like regular Alien Drones, however they only have a small chance to appear. Special Drones can be spotted by their bright flashing
colours, and will award you a large amount of points when destroyed. Special drones are explosive resistant, and can only be destroyed with a bullet.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Your Tools:

You have two different tools at your disposal to fend off the alien swarm, your Cannon, and your Shield.

Cannon: Your Spaceship is equipped with a Lazer cannon which uses energy stored in a reserviour on each side of your Ship to fire three energy bullets from the front of your
Vessel. This weapon takes a small amount of time to recharge after each use before it can be fired again.

Shield: Your Spaceship is equipped with a controllable energy shield which will deflect any missiles that hit it. This shield is essential in protecting your ship from alien
missiles. No matter where you move, your shield will always try to orient itself directly behind your spaceship unless you override it by pressing the A or D key to move the 
shield to the left or right side of your vessel. Deflected missiles may hit Alien drones, in which case they will explode, destroying any Drones caught in the explosion.
If another missile is caught in the explosion, it will also explode, increasing the area of the explosion and destroying more drones. Destroying drones with deflected missiles
Awards more points than shooting them.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Your Spaceship:

You are the lone pilot of a spaceship trapped in a swarm of alien drones. Your 'Health' is represented by a red Hull Integrity bar in the bottom right of the game screen,
and will empty as your spaceship is damaged. When the bar is empty, your ship is too damaged, and will explode, killing you.
Your objective is to survive as long as possible while accumulating the highest score you can.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Health Packs:

Health Packs are white, rounded objects with a green plus (+) symbol on them.
Shooting them will allow you to repair your Spaceship.
